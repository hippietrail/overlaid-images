# overlaid-images

Cross-fade between two images, especially an original photo and a generative AI image derived from
it:

The top, blue slider allows you to adjust the speed/frequency of the oscillation.

The bottom, red slider allows you to fine-tune the size of the translucent image on top to align
them manually.

If you add one new image, it will become the top, translucent image and the previous top image will
become the new bottom image.

If you add two images, they will become the new top and bottom images. (I'm not sure if the order
you select them in the image picker will always be preserved.)
